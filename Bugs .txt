I have identified 7 incidents:

1 - The user and password are not validated, you can put whaterething.
2 - The only mandatory field is firstName.
3 - The firstName is primary key.
4 - The mail field does not validate the format, example: qa@qa.com. It is the best candidate to be a primary key.
5 - The phone number allows letters and signs
6 - The mobile allows letters and signs
7 - White space is considered like data
